Hi, my name is Geoffrey Huntley, infrastructure #devopsec polyglot & software developer, co-founder of [Sydney Gamers League](/portfolio/sydney-gamers-league/) and the creator of the first [disaster/humanitarian video blog](/portfolio/waveofdestruction/) that on the day of the boxing day tsunami the world turned to for up-to-date information. I have also cycled through various countries on a unicycle.

When programming I tend to write in a asynchronous, functional reactive manner using the [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/) and [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com) but have been known to ship JavaScript (node.js) and Python. With Xamarin, applications are written entirely in [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) or [F#](https://fsharp.org), sharing the same core library code on iOS, Android &amp; Windows Phone. Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in .NET with Xamarin to create beautiful native apps.

I live in Sydney, Australia.

The opinions expressed on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients.

## Open Source

As part of constant and never ending learning, I'm actively engaged in contributing to the following Xamarin and .NET projects. Open-source for me is a way of life, when I'm not [authoring code](https://github.com/ghuntley/) you will find me [building communities](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/687), [passing down knowledge](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/pull/771) and [mentoring first timers](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI/issues/1005).
