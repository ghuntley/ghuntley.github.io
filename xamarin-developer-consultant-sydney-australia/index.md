Howdy, I've been involved in the Xamarin community since the ​monotouch/monodroid days. I'm the curator of the <a href="https://www.weeklyxamarin.com/">www.weeklyxamarin.com</a> newsletter and with friends, maintain Akavache, ModernHttpClient, Splat, Refit & ReactiveUI. Nerd snipe me (on Twitter) if you get caught in a jam, and I'll try and help out as much as possible. Open-source for me is a way of life and when I'm not authoring code, you will find me building communities, passing down knowledge and mentoring first timers.

If you’ve got a position in mind or a interesting project you want to get off the ground send a message via [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffreyhuntley) or an email to <a href="mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com?Subject='Xamarin Engagement'">ghuntley@ghuntley.com</a> with your requirements for a confidential discussion.
